# 2D Wave Equation FEM Solver

A quick and simple FEM solver for the 2-dimensional wave equation that uses the Newmark Method to comply with energy conservation constraints. Implemented with deal.II.

- **Spatial Discretization**: Galerkin Finite Element Method
- **Time Integration**: Newmark Method with central difference scheme
- **Energy Conservation**: Enforced through Newmark's time-stepping parameters
